# Spaceship Shooter Game

## Description
This is a simple spaceship shooter game built using Python and Pygame (Pygame Community Edition). The player controls a spaceship that can shoot lasers to destroy meteors. The game includes a player spaceship, meteor sprites, lasers, and a score system. The player scores points for destroying meteors, and if the player collides with a meteor, the game transitions to a "Game Over" screen. The player can restart or quit the game after the game is over.

## Features
- Pixel-perfect collision detection using Pygame masks.
- Laser shooting mechanics with cooldowns.
- Random meteor generation.
- Score tracking.
- Game over screen with restart and quit options.
- Simple star background effect.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame-ce (Pygame Community Edition)
